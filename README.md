so I was able to get the first iteration of the Facebook API working  however I was only able get it working outside of the EPA network because inside the EPA network I get an "X frame options denied message"  The other kind of tricky thing is that the scripts for the Facebook API need to be in the body tag according to Facebook documentation.
