so I was able to get the first iteration of the Facebook API working  however I was only able get it working outside of the EPA network because inside the EPA network I get an "X frame options denied message". I don't think it's the network. I think it's something to do with the Chrome browser settings on the EPA laptop. I tried it on my EPA laptop while off the EPA network and instead on my T-Mobile network. I still got the x-frame error even though I was not on EPA network.  The other kind of tricky thing is that the scripts for the Facebook API need to be in the body tag according to Facebook documentation.
